            I’m a passionate developer with experience in both frontend and
            backend technologies. My journey began in 2021 with an internship at
            Isolpro, followed by a Full-Stack Intern role at Onethread, where I
            worked on their product which a company management tool. Since then,
            I’ve tackled various projects, including developing a mental health
            app at Quality Life and created a dynamic Admin Dashboard for
            Wellavi. I also worked with Justice AI on a legal tech platform and
            developed Gadgetsallbd, an e-commerce site for a client. Currently,
            I’m involved in Golden Vault, a mentorship platform, and I’m seeking
            full-time opportunities in modern web technologies and aim to build
            a career in AI and IoT.
